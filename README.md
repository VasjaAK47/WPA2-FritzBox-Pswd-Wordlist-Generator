# WPA2-FritzBox-Pswd-Wordlist-Generator
This Script will produce all of the WPA2 Passwords used by various Router companies aswell as Fritzbox. All of these Passwords will be 16 Numbers in length. So it could get a bit large. If anybody has got some extra SSDs feel free to send them over. 

### Usage:
```
$ ./WordlistGenerator.perl > All16Nums-Wordlist.txt
```

### To Do:
- FritzBox never have Passwords with three same Numbers after each other so we could reduce this

Please feel free to help improve and lets try to get these Wordlists together. 

Enjoy,
